An extension that listens to you and copies what you said to the clipboard.

Copy to Clipboard
・ Unlike other “voice typing” extensions, vx only copies what you said to the clipboard, and doesn’t type the text for you.
・ Therefore, it works with all apps that lets you paste in text; not just Google Chrome.
・ If the speech recognizer did not get it right, just say the phrase again (more slowly and clearly).
・ This makes it convenient for non-native speakers, not having to press the undo every time.
・ Some early users reported having 2x productivity over conventional voice typing solutions (such as the built-in Dictation that comes with macOS).

Language Support
・ Uses Google’s Web Speech API to do the speech recognition.
・ It supports at least 60 language and 101 dialects.

Bilingual Users Friendly
・ You can set up your “primary language” and “secondary language” and assign hotkeys to each language.

Display Output
・ vx displays the recognized text as you speak in a webpage or in a popup window. Can be enabled/disabled.

Notification Output
・ vx can display a notification when text is copied to the clipboard. Can be enabled/disabled.

Sound Feedback
・ vx emits a sound when the speech recognition session begins and ends, as well as when text is copied to the clipboard. Can be enabled/disabled.

Permissions
・ vx doesn’t require the “Read and change all your data on the websites you visit” permission.
・ vx doesn’t require the “Communicate with cooperating websites” permission.
・ vx requires microphone, clipboard, and notification access.

Totally Free
・ There is no paid version.
・ No support is provided for this extension either.
・ If you encounter any issue, the source code is available for you to build and debug yourself at https://github.com/dtinth/vxchrome.
